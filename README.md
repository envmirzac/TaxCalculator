# Personal Income Tax Calculator

This Python program calculates the Personal Income Tax (PIT) based on the given annual income. It follows the tax rules of a fictional country. Here's how the tax is calculated:

- If the citizen's income is less than 85,528 thalers, the tax is calculated as 18% of the income minus 556.02 thalers and 2 cents (tax relief). If the calculated tax is less than or equal to zero, it is considered as zero.
- If the income is greater than 85,528 thalers, the tax is calculated as 14,839.02 thalers plus 32% of the surplus over 85,528 thalers.

## Usage

1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Enter the annual income when prompted.
3. The program will calculate the tax based on the given income and print the result rounded to the nearest thaler.


In this fictional country, if the calculated tax is less than zero, it means there is no tax at all, and the tax is considered as zero.

Feel free to use this program to calculate personal income taxes in this fictional country.

Note: this happy country never returns money to its citizens. If the calculated tax is less than zero, it only means no tax at all (the tax is equal to zero). Take this into consideration during your calculations.
